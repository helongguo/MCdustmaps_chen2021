# Dust maps in the Magellanic Clouds

Based on the data from the optical and near-infrared (IR) photometric surveys, including the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia eDR3), the SkyMapper Southern Survey DR2 (SMSS DR2), the Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History (SMASH), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the near-infrared VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC), we have obtained a multi-band photometric stellar sample of over 9 million stars in the LMC and SMC area. We applied the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to the individual sample stars to estimate their reddening values. As a result, we have derived the best-fitting reddening values of about 1.9 million stars in the LMC, 1.5 million stars in the SMC and 0.6 million stars in the MW, which are used to construct dust reddening maps in the MCs. The maps cover the Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC and SMC) area and have a resolution of about 26 arcsec â€“ 55 arcmin.

For more details, one can refer to our published paper at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.tmp..102C/abstract.

# Data access

Our reddening maps can be accessed at: http://paperdata.china-vo.org/diskec/mcdust/mcmap.fits.

The final catalogue containing the best-fit values of E(B-V) from our SED fitting of about 4 million stars can be accessed at: http://paperdata.china-vo.org/diskec/mcdust/starebv.fits. The Milky Way foreground reddening maps of the area toward the Magellanic Clouds can be accessed at: http://paperdata.china-vo.org/diskec/mcdust/mwmap.fits. 
# How to use the maps

To use our maps, we have provided a pyton procedure 'chen2021.py'. The procedure relies on the `dustmaps` package (https://github.com/gregreen/dustmaps).

The following steps show how to install our procedure:
1. Install the `dustmaps` package (pip install dustmaps).
2. Download the procedure 'chen2021.py' in this project and put the procedure in the `dustmaps` directory. 
3. Download the reddening maps (http://paperdata.china-vo.org/diskec/mcdust/mcmap.fits) to the '/path/where/you/want/large/data/files/stored'.


An example is given below to show how to obtain E(B-V) values from our dust maps:

    >>> from dustmaps.config import config
    >>> config['data_dir'] = '/path/where/you/want/large/data/files/stored'
    >>> from dustmaps.chen2021 import Chen2021Query
    >>> from astropy.coordinates import SkyCoord
    >>> from astropy import units as u
    >>>
    >>> ebv = Chen2021Query()
    >>> ra = np.array([81.28,12.80])
    >>> dec = np.array([-69.78,-73.15])
    >>> c = SkyCoord(ra=ra*u.degree,dec=dec*u.degree,frame='icrs')  
    >>> ebv(c)
        array([[0.1063],[0.0076]], dtype=float32)

# Conditions for using the program

The program relies on the [`astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord`](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.html#astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord) and [`dustmaps`](https://github.com/gregreen/dustmaps)package. 
The `dustmaps` package provides a uniform interface for dealing with a number of 2D and 3D maps of interstellar dust reddening/extinction. For details and how to install, please refer to https://github.com/gregreen/dustmaps
